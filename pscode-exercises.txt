// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If num %2 print even 
Else print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) print (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 
b) num 1 + num 2 + num 3 + num 4 + num 5 = sum 
Sum % 5 
Print output from sum % 5 
c) num1, num2, num3, num4, num5 
of these numbers print the min and max 
d) For part b say the numbers are (1,2,3,4,5) then the average would be add 1+2+3+4+5 which =15 divided by 5 is 3. For part c if the numbers are (1,2,3,4,5) then the min would be 1 and the max would be 5.
